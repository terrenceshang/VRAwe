The Elicitation of Awe in Virtual Reality

Proposer: James Gain

Supervisor/Co-supervisors: James Gain, Gosia Lipinska

Abbreviation: VRAwe

Brief Description: Virtual Reality has been widely and successfully used to treat phobias through
exposure therapy. As a typical example someone with a fear of public speaking might be presented with
a virtual crowd and asked to speak briefly. Through repeated exposure that gradually increases in
realism the phobia can often be significantly reduced. One requirement of the associated virtual
environment is that it should elicit a controlled fear response in the participant. This can be measured
using psychophysiological apparatus, that capture heart rate, skin conductance, pupillometry, etc. What
has been less explored is other types of emotional responses to Virtual Environments that could be
useful in psychological treatment. For instance, eliciting awe in a controlled fashion may be useful in the
treatment of depression. More broadly, in storytelling terms it is useful for a Virtual Environment to have
a certain ambiance that evokes an emotional response. This will be useful for entertainment
applications, such as games. The project will involve developing a Virtual Reality environment, guided
by previous work [1], capable of eliciting awe as the dominant emotional response. This will need to be
tested through user experiments and the psychology department will provide guidance on relevant
aspects of the experiment design.

Experimental Study, Frontiers in Psychology, vol. 8, 2018, p. 2351

Computer Science Content: Virtual Reality, Computer Graphics, Human Computer Interaction

Specific Learning Outcomes: Designing emotive virtual environments; design and analysis of
quantitative user experiments.

Skills Required by Team as a Whole: Some exposure to Unity and 3D Modelling, although this is not
required of all team members.

Theory: Emotive virtual scene generation; psychophysiological measurement; experiment design; some
psychology.

Implementation: Development of a virtual environment designed in collaboration with the psychology
department that is configurable at run time for various levels of interactivity and is capable of eliciting an
awe response. Depending on the number of students, more than one environment may be developed.

Data: Some VR models to be purchased from the Unity store.

Facilities needed: Access to High-end Desktop PC and HTC Vive VR Equipment. Use of the
psychophysiological measurement equipment and software in the CS VR Lab.

CS Honours Projects 2023 16

Supervision: Weekly or biweekly meetings with supervisors and occasional attendance and
presentation at larger postgraduate research group meetings.

Number of Students: 2-3
